It's been a while since I last updated my GitHub, but I'm excited to announce that I'm back and ready to share my latest updates with you all!

I recently updated my project which-episode-to-watch-again to start using AWS Lambda as its backend. This was necessary because the new Heroku plans made it impossible to deploy the project without paying, and I wanted to continue providing this service without me needing to pay anything.

In addition to switching to AWS Lambda, I also added compatibility with Prime Video TV shows. This was a feature that i wanted to implement since the beginning but i didn't find a  easier way to extract ID's of their series, and I'm happy to say that it's now available for users. The first one added was The Office, but more TV shows are coming.

I also took the opportunity to update the design of my blog. I added tags for posts, which makes it easier to find posts on specific topics. I also improved the overall layout to make the blog more user-friendly.

Looking ahead, I'm planning to return to developing my project kanban-for-tv-shows. This project is a personal Kanban board that allows users to organize and keep track of their favorite TV shows. I'm really excited about this project, and I can't wait to share more updates with you all in the future.

In conclusion, it's been a busy few months for me, but I'm glad to be back.

Stay tuned for more updates on my projects in the coming weeks
